Introduction
------------
email is a commandline program to create a Groupwise account from an existing NDS account. The program can also delete
Groupwise and/or NDS accounts.


Program arguments
-----------------
Groupwise server - this is the full path to wpdomain.db on the server
Groupwise ID - make this the same as the Novell CN
DN of user in NDS - this is in dotted notation, not the comma notation of LDAP
Groupwise password - make this the same as the Novell password
Domain - the name of the domain in which to create the user
Post office - the name of the postoffice in which to create the user.
Visibility - either "domain" or "system"
Mode - one of: "adduser"  - create a Groupwise account for the existing NDS user
               "delgw"    - delete the specified Groupwise user
               "delnds"   - delete the NDS account for the specified user
               "delgwnds" - dekete the Groupwise and NDS accounts for the specified user

In all the delete modes, the program uses the "DN of user in NDS" commandline argument to locate the user in
the specified domain, to find out what postoffice they're in.
When using "delnds" or "delgwnds", the user's home directory will not be affected. Only their NDS account will
be deleted.
User object commit wait in seconds - how long to wait before trying to commit user changed in Groupwise
